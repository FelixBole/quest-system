# Quest System

A customizable quest system manager enabling quest creation, quest events, and all kind of additional custom interactions. The system is built to be as abstract as possible, so things like dialogue or inventory items getting used / received as rewards are not included in this system so you can plug in your own Dialogue system or Inventory system to it.
